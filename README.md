DoBeDo
===========

DoBeDo applies the notion of quantified self to the question of how to spend our
time if optimizing for happiness. Users track how they feel before and after
regular activities to better recognize which ones have the most positive impact 
on their mood. 

At signup, they select up to ten activities to track. Going forward, they record 
when they plan to do an activity and how they're feeling about doing it. Afterward,
once they've done it, they then log at what time they finished and 
how they actually felt doing it. The app provides a visualization of their 
expected and actual sentiments toward all recorded occurrences of each activity 
over time. Also, if the user provides their phone number when signing up for an 
account, they receive an automated text message reminder if 24 hours have passed
since the stated starting time for a planned activity and they haven't yet 
recorded how they felt about it afterward.

#### About the Developer

Amber recently graduated from the full-stack software engineering fellowship at 
Hackbright Academy in San Francisco. This is her first web application, and 
her favorite parts about building it were creating the data model, unbreaking 
(and sometimes re-breaking and then again unbreaking) things, and coming to 
really appreciate the convenience and elegance provided by an ORM.
